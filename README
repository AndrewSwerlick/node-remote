node-remote is a simple web server/webpage pair that allows you to remotely control the display on the server by browsing to a webpage on any client machine. The page picks up mouse movements and keyboard presses and transmits them to the server via socket.io.

RUNNING THE SERVER
Start the server with the command node remote-server.js. Note you have to run this command from within the display that you want to be controlling, not a remote session.

Then just have your client browse to port 8000 on the server. Note the client needs to support websockets, so either chrome or firefox is your best bet.
